<h1>User Guide</h1>
<p>Welcome to AceB. You can access this via the Home button which is shaped like a little computer
on the action bar. That is until you retrieve your own URL, and this window gets re-purposed.
Each machine type available in the settings, has its own guide which can be shown by switching
to that machine type. For example <a href="../Tester/index.html">this</a> is the self test guide.
</p>
<p>The action bar has the following options
<ul>
<li><image src="../action/ic_action_computer.png" alt="@string/icon_help">Home: Switch between here and the display console and back again.</li>
<li><image src="../action/ic_action_edit.png" alt="@string/icon_help">Edit: Open the command entry view, and in the view enter the commands.</li>
<li><image src="../action/ic_action_play.png" alt="@string/icon_help">Load: Load the machine backup.</li>

<li><image src="../action/ic_action_refresh.png" alt="@string/icon_help">Reset: Just like the machine was switched on first.</li>
<li><image src="../action/ic_action_share.png" alt="@string/icon_help">Share: Share the saved, not the active, machine state.</li>
