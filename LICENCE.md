# OPEN SOURE USEFUL LICENCE

I grant permission to use this code as is, under any of the following.

* Any version of the GPL (Not GLPL) licence, available elswhere on the net.
* Any version of the BSD licence.
* Strictly private paid via negotiation.
* Open semi private, no payment, but you MUST submit source to me for me to potentially include in further versions under this same licence.

The option to include licence (number 4) does not mean inclusion will occur EVER.

Thanks for your consideration

Simon Jackson, BEng.
